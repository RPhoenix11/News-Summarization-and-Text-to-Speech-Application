# News Summarization and Text-to-Speech Application

This application extracts key details from multiple news articles related to a given company, performs sentiment analysis, conducts a comparative analysis, and generates a text-to-speech (TTS) output in Hindi.

## Features

- **News Extraction**: Extracts news articles from various sources using BeautifulSoup
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes sentiment of news articles (positive, negative, neutral)
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compares sentiment across articles and identifies common themes
- **Topic Extraction**: Identifies key topics for each article
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts summarized content to Hindi speech
- **Web Interface**: Simple UI built with Streamlit and Gradio
- **API**: Backend APIs for frontend communication

## Installation & Setup

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-summarization-app.git
   cd news-summarization-app
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the API server:
   ```bash
   python api.py
   ```

5. In a new terminal, run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Models and Implementation Details

### News Extraction

The application uses BeautifulSoup to extract news articles from various sources. It fetches the HTML content of news pages and parses it to extract relevant information such as the title, content, and publication date.

### Sentiment Analysis

The sentiment analysis component uses NLTK's VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analyzer. This is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media and news articles.

### Text-to-Speech

The text-to-speech functionality uses the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library to convert the summarized content into Hindi speech. In a production environment, more advanced TTS solutions like Mozilla TTS or Hugging Face's speech synthesis models could be used for better quality.

### Comparative Analysis

The comparative analysis component performs a cross-article analysis to identify common themes, sentiment trends, and topic overlaps. It generates insights into how different news sources are covering the company.

## API Documentation

The application exposes several API endpoints for communication between the frontend and backend:

- `GET /api/health`: Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/news?company={company_name}`: Fetches news articles for a given company
- `POST /api/analyze`: Performs sentiment and topic analysis on provided articles
- `POST /api/tts`: Generates Hindi TTS from a report
- `GET /api/full_analysis?company={company_name}`: Combined endpoint for fetching news, analyzing sentiment, and generating TTS

## Assumptions & Limitations

- The application assumes that the news sources are accessible and can be scraped using BeautifulSoup.
- For Hindi translation, the application uses a simple approach. In a production environment, this would be replaced with a more sophisticated translation service.
- The sentiment analysis is based on NLTK's VADER, which may not capture all nuances in financial news.
- The application may not handle all edge cases related to news source formatting variations.

## Future Improvements

- Implement caching to reduce API calls
- Add more sophisticated translation services
- Improve topic extraction using NER (Named Entity Recognition)
- Implement user authentication and result history
- Add more visualization options for comparative analysis
